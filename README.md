# Grid-Move-Grids
Grids I have created to be used with the GridMove Window Management Program

Grid Move is a great Window Mangement utility that helps you organize your windows on the screen. The postions of the grids are dictated by the `.grid` files and using them you can easily drag and postion the windows in the required position of the grids.
